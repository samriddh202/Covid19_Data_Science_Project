# Covid19_Data_Science_Project


The outbreak of Covid-19 is a hot topic of discussion all around the world. Covid-19 is now spread in 210 countries and is threatening the lives of millions. People all around the world are trying to help with whatever they can. they are also showing great acts of bravery and kindness to the poor and those in need. I wish to give my respect to those who have died and there to family members for there losses. In this project, I try to display the data I got from the internet about the virus in certain countries and try to find any relationship based on data and make models from it and prediction based on it. As we all know that  Doctors all around the world are trying their best to keep the death toll to a minimum. The question that I wish to answer here is whether the data we got could be of help to anyone and the visualization that I made could be of use in any research. The two cases which I study were India and Italy. I chose India as it is my home country and has the second-highest population in the world, but we still have a lot fewer cases in terms of China which has the highest population. I chose Italy as my second case study because it was gaining a lot of attention from news media because of its higher number of dead people there.
